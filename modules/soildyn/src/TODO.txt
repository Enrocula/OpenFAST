To Do

DRIVER

Output file


MODULE
------

Outputs

Change over all use of Force to R8Ki from REDWIN dll.  Convert at final output from module only.

Input file changes
handling of the runmode (RW Model 1)

Mesh nodes connection to the glue code / SubDyn
Stiffness matrix to summary file (and notes)

pass in mudline depth


OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS
---------------------
Since we have StVar, can we do correction steps by saving the old copy, and replacing it on corrections?


GLUE CODE
---------

everything




NOTES:
--------
- confirmed that stiffmatrix does not take into account the displacement
- confirmed we need different copies of dll's if multiple used



==========================================================================
FROM the Email/meetings

-	Input file
   -	Remove “DLL_ProcName” line
   -	Reference system – define relative to global – but do some error checking on this
   -	Should pass in water depth – to create warning if the points are not defined below the mudline (-z value)
   -	Change to capital (X,Y,Z)
   -	Include DLL name for each point, and ensure they are unique.
   -	Comments on “Model used in DLL”
   -	Include units of stiffness and damping matrix.
   -	Include ability to enter multiple stiffness/damping matrices for a jacket.  
-	Error handling for the input files vs model being used.
-	Is there cross-talk between DLL calls at multiple points?  Need to create a different DLL for each call. 
-	Verification approach – ideas?
   -	Connect with Erin to do some spot checking.
-	Implement the ability to input a time-varying force at the tower top
