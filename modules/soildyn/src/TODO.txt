To Do
=====

DRIVER
------

Output file


MODULE
------

Outputs  (number as standard 1-9 numbers for now...) -- should these be 'g' for global???
   -  Sld#TD{xyz} (m)
   -  Sld#RD{xyz} (deg)
   -  Sld#F{xyz}  (kN)
   -  Sld#M{xyz}  (kN-m)

summary file 
   -  outputs, and what points they correspond to
   -  which mesh point the point links to
   -  stiffness matrix at each point
   -  mudline passed in (based on water depth from HD?)

Input file changes
runmode
   -  model 1 includes this (given in Props(1,1) at init)
   -  model 2 does not include this????
   -  model 3 does not include this????

Mesh nodes connection to the glue code / SubDyn
Stiffness matrix to summary file (and notes)

pass in mudline depth


OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS
---------------------
Since we have StVar, can we do correction steps by saving the old copy, and replacing it on corrections?


GLUE CODE
---------

everything




NOTES:
--------
- confirmed that stiffmatrix does not take into account the displacement
- confirmed we need different copies of dll's if multiple used



==========================================================================
FROM the Email/meetings

-	Input file
   -	Remove “DLL_ProcName” line
   -	Reference system – define relative to global – but do some error checking on this
   -	Should pass in water depth – to create warning if the points are not defined below the mudline (-z value)
   -	Change to capital (X,Y,Z)
   x	Include DLL name for each point, and ensure they are unique.
   -	Comments on “Model used in DLL”
   -	Include units of stiffness and damping matrix.
   -	Include ability to enter multiple stiffness/damping matrices for a jacket.  
-	Error handling for the input files vs model being used.
   --> no good method known as yet.
-	Is there cross-talk between DLL calls at multiple points?  Need to create a different DLL for each call. 
-	Verification approach – ideas?
   -	Connect with Erin to do some spot checking.
-	Implement the ability to input a time-varying force at the tower top
